=head2 roundnear

Round a number near the precision of the supplied one.

    roundnear( 0.01, 12345.678) => 12345.68

=head2 virgule

Produce a more human readbale number with a provided number of decimal points

    virgule(12345.679, 1) => 12,345.7

=cut

        }
        $output = (join ',', @segments) . $last_num;
    }

    return $output;
}

=head2 to_monetary_number_format

Produce a nice human readable number which looks like a currency

    to_monetary_number_format(123456789) => 123,456,789.00

=cut

sub to_monetary_number_format {
    # This routine is adjusted for our system, but the basic algorithm
    # is from Perl Cookbook, 1st Ed, Recipe 2.17
    my ($text, $remove_decimal_for_ints) = @_;

    $text //= 0;

    if (looks_like_number($text)) {

        $text =~ s/(\d\d\d)(?=\d)(?!\d*\.)/$1,/g;

        $text =~ s/\.00$// if ($remove_decimal_for_ints);
    }
